Heart Rate Assignment

For a clinical trial, it is required to calculate some statistics for patients' heart rate data. 
The input “heartrate.json” file contains heart rate measurements collected by a patient over several days. 
Each measurement consists of beats per minute and timestamps when the measurement was taken (start and end timestamps). 
Using JavaScript/TypeScript write an aggregator script that reads the input “heartrate.json” file and 
calculates the minimum, maximum and median beats per minute and the latest data timestamp (timestamp of the last measurement in the day) for each day. 
Output should look like this
[
   {
     "date": "2023-04-28”,
     "min": 60,
     "max": 119,
     "median": 81,
     "latestDataTimestamp": "2023-04-28T21:54:00"
   },
  …..
]
The output needs to be written to a file “output.json”. 
Upload the project including input and created output files to your GitHub and provide the link. Also include a README file with instructions on how to build and run your project.
